Welcome to the InternLM organization. InternLM is mainly developed by Shanghai AI Laboratory. We keep open-sourcing high quality LLMs as well as a full-stack toolchain for development and application.

## Models

- [InternLM](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM): a series of multi-lingual foundation models and chat models.
- [InternLM-XComposer](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer): a vision-language large model (VLLM) based on InternLM for advanced text-image comprehension and composition.

## Toolchain

- [InternEvo](https://github.com/InternLM/InternEvo/): a lightweight framework for large-scale model pre-training and finetuning.
- [XTuner](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner): a toolkit for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs, supporting various models and fintuning algorithms.
- [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy): a toolkit for compressing, deploying, and serving LLMs.
- [Lagent](https://github.com/InternLM/lagent): a lightweight framework that allows users to efficiently build LLM-based agents.
- [AgentLego](https://github.com/InternLM/agentlego): a library of versatile tool APIs to extend and enhance LLM-based agents, compatible with Lagent, Langchain, etc.
- [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass): a platform for large model evaluation, providing a fair, open, and reproducible benchmark.
- [OpenAOE](https://github.com/InternLM/OpenAOE): an elegant and out-of-the-box chat UI for comparing mulitple models.

## Applications
- [HuixiangDou](https://github.com/InternLM/HuixiangDou): a domain-specific assistant based on LLMs which can deal with complex techinical questions in group chats.
